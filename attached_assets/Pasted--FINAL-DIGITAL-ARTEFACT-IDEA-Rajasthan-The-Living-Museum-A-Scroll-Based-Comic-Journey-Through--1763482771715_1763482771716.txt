🌟 FINAL DIGITAL ARTEFACT IDEA
“Rajasthan: The Living Museum — A Scroll-Based Comic Journey Through Culture & History”
An interactive web comic that reveals Rajasthan’s untold stories through visuals, sound, and micro-interactions.

🧠 CORE IDEA (in one line)
A vertical parallax story website, where each scroll reveals a new region of Rajasthan with:
    • Comic panels illustrating local culture
    • Ambient audio representing each region
    • Historical context in short, sharp, accurate text
    • Interactive “reveal layers” (show old map → show present → show story)
    • Cultural objects that float into view as you scroll
No gameplay. No movement control.
Just immersive scroll → see → learn experience.

🎨 VISUAL STRUCTURE (what the user actually sees)
📌 Scrolling Experience
    • Background gradually shifts colors as the user scrolls
    • Each region appears like a mini-chapter
    • Soft animations:
        ◦ Frescos fade in
        ◦ Stepwell water shimmers
        ◦ Puppets swing slightly
        ◦ Palace outlines emerge from fog
    • A subtle “museum label” appears at each stop
    • Hear Local Sound in background
📌 Style Inspirations
    • Amar Chitra Katha (line art + bold colors)
    • Shekhawati fresco palette (pinks, indigos, terracotta)
    • Japanese scroll storytelling (vertical narrative)
    • Neal.fun smooth parallax transitions

🌍 REGIONAL + LOCATION-BASED STORY SECTIONS
Each section has:
    1. Title
    2. Ambient sound button
    3. Scroll comic strip (3–5 panels)
    4. Cultural object pop-up
    5. History explanation
    6. Local insight (traditions, customs, lesser-known facts)
